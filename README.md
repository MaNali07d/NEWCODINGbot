# 📊 My First AI/Data Science Project

Welcome to my first project in AI & Data Science! This is part of my learning journey where I explore Python, data analysis, and machine learning step by step.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project covers:
- Basics of Python programming
- Data cleaning and analysis
- Simple visualizations using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`
- [Optional] Intro to machine learning with `scikit-learn`

## 📁 Files in this Repo

- `notebook.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with code and output
- `data.csv` – Sample dataset used in the project
- `README.md` – Project description and notes

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn *(if used)*

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to work with data in Python
- Data cleaning techniques
- Visualizing data
- [Any other things you learned]

## 📌 Next Steps

- Improve this project with new datasets
- Try more visualizations
- Start a beginner ML model
